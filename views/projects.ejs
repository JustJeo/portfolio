  <h2><span>Burger Builder</span> - October 9th, 2020 </h2>
    <p>Burger Builder is my first project ever. It was the first project assigned to students in the coding program I had taken. The project was required to be front-end only and had to be a game. All of the functionality for the game had to be done through DOM Manipulation.</p>
    
    <p>The game placed players in the shoes of a chef. Players are given one minute to build randomly picked orders from "customers". The burger must be built from the bottom up and sent for inspection. With every correct order players will earn points and any wrong order loses points.</p>

  <h2><span>Better Boothang</span> - October 30th, 2020</h2>
    <p>For my first team project ever, my class was divided into pre-assigned teams of three. My teammates were Derek Foster and Booker Showers III. We had just finished up learning about back-end development and one of the main requirements was that a user could create an account on our app.</p>
    
    <p>The app was created from the idea of one of our program instructors who jokingly pitched the idea. We as a team wanted to turn his silly thought into a reality. The app allowed users to store the numbers of their favorite people and send them pre-generated text messages from a list. The app was meant to help individuals, that couldn't think of what to say, send messages with all of the right words.</p>

  <h2><span>Collabathon</span> - November 24th, 2020</h2>
    <p>In order for students to understand what work in the real world was like, a collaboration project between a Software Engineer class and a UX Designer class was made for a 24-hour sprint. Teams consisted of 2 students from each class to make a 4 member group. My Software Engineering partner was Jane Cho.</p>
    
    <p>The project was to have UX Designers come up with a prototype that Software Engineers had to replicate to the best of their abilities in the allotted time. In the pictures below, the prototype design created by the UX class is the first picture (shown on top), while the final version of the software engineer replica is the second (shown on bottom).</p>

  <h2><span>Soul Sip'n</span> - November 30th, 2020</h2>
    <p>Wrapping up the lessons on React, the 3rd project for the coding program allowed students to choose their teams. Students could choose between going solo, a duo team, or teaming up with 2 other students to create a final team of 3. I chose my teammates Brock Molmen and Lauren Nguyen. The project required students to use at <i>least</i> PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js.</p>
    
    <p>The project we created was a tea informational app that allowed users to view many different types of teas as well as see the benefits of each individual tea. Users were able to create a profile and save their favorite teas. A registered user can also save a specified benefit to only allow teas that fit that criteria to display in a search result.</p>

  <h2><span>Heart Of Blink</span> - December 17th, 2020</h2>
    <p>The final project for the program was a mandatory solo project. Students were given the liberty to create whatever they wanted to. The only catch was that the app had to have a front-end and back-end to its code as well as push the student's ability to code by themselves. If a student obviously did not put their skills to the test then they would not receive a passing grade. My love for video games swayed in my decision to make another game. I am not a strong back-end developer so I took this opportunity to test myself by creating a game that required a lot of back-end code.</p>
    
    <p>The game is based on the Korean pop group BLACKPINK and is played as a fill-in-the-blank. Players would be able to chose a song from the group's library of songs and is faced with 10 questions. Players are then given blanks to type in the correct answer. After submitting their answers, the correct answers would be displayed along with the player's guess.</p>
